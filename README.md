This repository is for getting familiar with using basics Git commands and the Git environment. The "About Me" website created using the ChatGPT AI website is added to the repo. After that is done locally, the repo is then delivered remotely to my public GitHub account. I downloaded git for windows 64 bit from git's website. I installed it. I initialized the git in the folder containing the html files. I configured the repo with my personal info. I added the files to the repo, committed the changes, created a new repo in my remote GitHub, linked my local repo to the github, pushed the local repo to the remote, and verified the files are in GitHub. Every step went extremely well with no barriers. I attempted to do step 10 but there was no source option there because I was in my account settings and not in the repo. I went to the url for the repo and clicked the settings in the header and then success.
